The pull request (PR) workflow is a fundamental part of collaboration and code review in Git-based version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It allows developers to propose changes to a repository and request that someone review and merge those changes into the main branch. Here's a detailed explanation of the pull request workflow with examples from an organization:

### Pull Request Workflow

#### 1. Forking the Repository (Optional)

If you do not have write access to the repository, you might fork it first:

1. **Fork the Repository**: On GitHub or a similar platform, click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

#### 2. Creating a New Branch

Before making changes, create a new branch to isolate your work:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Switch to your local repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

#### 3. Making Changes

Make changes to the codebase in your feature branch:

1. **Modify Files**: Make your changes to the codebase, add new features, fix bugs, etc.
   ```bash
   # Make changes to files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement new feature X"
   ```

#### 4. Pushing Changes to Remote

Push your changes to your remote repository (origin):

1. **Push Changes**: Push your feature branch to your remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

#### 5. Creating a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed to your remote repository, create a pull request to propose merging your changes into the main repository:

1. **Navigate to Repository**: Go to the main repository on GitHub or your Git platform.

2. **Compare & Pull Request**: Click on the "Compare & pull request" button next to your pushed branch.

3. **Create Pull Request**: Fill out the pull request form with details about your changes:
   - Title: Concise summary of the changes.
   - Description: Detailed explanation of what the pull request does.
   - Reviewers: Select reviewers to review your changes.
   - Labels: Optionally add labels like "bug", "feature", etc.
   - Assignees: Assign specific team members for further actions.

4. **Create Pull Request**: Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit your pull request.

#### 6. Reviewing Changes

Team members or reviewers will review your pull request:

1. **Review Changes**: Reviewers can view the changes, add comments, approve, request changes, or discuss improvements.

2. **Address Feedback**: Make any necessary changes based on the feedback received.

#### 7. Merging Pull Request

Once the pull request is approved and passes all checks (e.g., tests, code style):

1. **Merge Pull Request**: Click on the "Merge pull request" button to merge your changes into the main branch.

2. **Delete Branch**: Optionally, delete the feature branch after merging to keep the repository clean:
   - You can delete the branch on GitHub or use Git locally:
     ```bash
     git branch -d feature-branch
     ```

#### Example from an Organization

Let's assume an organization named "TechCo" uses GitHub for its development workflow:

1. **Fork and Clone**: Developer forks the main repository, clones it locally, and creates a new branch.

2. **Make Changes**: Developer implements a new feature in their feature branch and commits the changes.

3. **Push Branch**: Developer pushes the feature branch to their forked repository on GitHub.

4. **Create Pull Request**: Developer creates a pull request from their feature branch to the main repository.

5. **Review and Approve**: Team members review the pull request, provide feedback, and approve it after confirming it meets the project's standards.

6. **Merge Changes**: A maintainer merges the pull request into the main branch after all checks and reviews are completed.

7. **Cleanup**: Once merged, the feature branch is deleted to keep the repository tidy.

### Benefits of Pull Request Workflow

- **Code Review**: Ensures code quality and knowledge sharing within the team.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration among team members and contributors.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes and allows discussions on specific lines of code.
- **Integration**: Integrates new features and bug fixes in a controlled and systematic manner.

### Best Practices

- **Small Pull Requests**: Submit small, focused pull requests that are easier to review.
- **Clear Descriptions**: Provide clear descriptions of changes and their purpose.
- **Review Guidelines**: Follow established review guidelines and coding standards.
- **Automated Tests**: Include automated tests to validate changes and ensure functionality.

By following this pull request workflow, teams can efficiently collaborate, review, and integrate changes into their codebase while maintaining code quality and project standards.

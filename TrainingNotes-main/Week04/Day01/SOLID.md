Solid Design Principles are a set of five principles in object-oriented programming that help developers design robust, maintainable, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are often used as guidelines for writing clean code.

### SOLID Principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Example:**
```java
class Invoice {
    private Order order;

    public Invoice(Order order) {
        this.order = order;
    }

    public void generateInvoice() {
        // logic to generate invoice
    }
}

class InvoicePrinter {
    public void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
        // logic to print invoice
    }
}

class InvoiceSaver {
    public void saveInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
        // logic to save invoice to a database
    }
}
```
In this example, the responsibilities of generating, printing, and saving an invoice are separated into different classes.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Definition:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Example:**
```java
abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double area();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return length * width;
    }
}
```
Here, `Shape` can be extended with new types of shapes without modifying the existing code.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Definition:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Example:**
```java
class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        // fly logic
    }
}

class Sparrow extends Bird {
    // Sparrow inherits fly behavior from Bird
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostriches can't fly");
    }
}
```
In this case, `Ostrich` violates LSP because it cannot fly, which is expected behavior for `Bird`. A better approach would be to redesign the class hierarchy.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Definition:** No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This principle is about creating specific interfaces.

**Example:**
```java
interface Printer {
    void printDocument();
}

interface Scanner {
    void scanDocument();
}

class AllInOnePrinter implements Printer, Scanner {
    @Override
    public void printDocument() {
        // print logic
    }

    @Override
    public void scanDocument() {
        // scan logic
    }
}

class SimplePrinter implements Printer {
    @Override
    public void printDocument() {
        // print logic
    }
}
```
In this example, clients can implement only the interfaces they need, adhering to ISP.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**Example:**
```java
interface Database {
    void saveData(String data);
}

class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
    @Override
    public void saveData(String data) {
        // save data to MySQL
    }
}

class Application {
    private Database database;

    public Application(Database database) {
        this.database = database;
    }

    public void processData(String data) {
        // process data
        database.saveData(data);
    }
}
```
Here, `Application` depends on the `Database` interface, not a specific implementation, adhering to DIP.

By following these principles, developers can create software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

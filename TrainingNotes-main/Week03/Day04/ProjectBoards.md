Project boards are visual tools used to track and manage tasks, projects, and workflows. They are essential in Agile methodologies, like Scrum and Kanban, and are widely used across various industries to enhance productivity and transparency. Here's a detailed look at project boards:

### Types of Project Boards

1. **Kanban Boards**
   - **Purpose**: To visualize and manage workflow, limit work in progress (WIP), and enhance process efficiency.
   - **Structure**:
     - **Columns**: Represent different stages of the workflow, typically "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
     - **Cards**: Represent individual tasks or work items that move through the columns.
     - **WIP Limits**: Constraints on the number of tasks that can be in a particular column at any time to prevent bottlenecks.
   - **Usage**:
     - Visualize all tasks and their status at a glance.
     - Identify bottlenecks and optimize workflow.

2. **Scrum Boards**
   - **Purpose**: To track progress during a sprint, visualize the sprint backlog, and ensure the team stays on track to meet sprint goals.
   - **Structure**:
     - **Columns**: Typically include "To Do," "In Progress," "In Review," and "Done."
     - **Swimlanes**: Can be used to separate tasks by priority, assignee, or user story.
     - **Sprint Backlog**: Tasks or user stories committed for the sprint.
   - **Usage**:
     - Used during daily stand-ups to update the team on progress.
     - Helps in identifying impediments and facilitating discussions on how to overcome them.

3. **Task Boards**
   - **Purpose**: General-purpose boards used to track tasks in various projects, not necessarily tied to a specific methodology.
   - **Structure**:
     - **Columns**: Flexible and customizable based on project needs (e.g., "Ideas," "In Progress," "Blocked," "Completed").
     - **Cards**: Represent individual tasks or subtasks.
   - **Usage**:
     - Suitable for personal task management or smaller team projects.
     - Offers flexibility to adapt to various project management styles.

### Key Components of Project Boards

1. **Columns**
   - Represent stages in the workflow.
   - Common columns include "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," "Done."
   - Can be customized to fit specific project needs (e.g., "Backlog," "Design," "Development," "Testing").

2. **Cards**
   - Represent individual tasks or work items.
   - Contain details such as task description, assignee, due dates, and priority.
   - Can be enriched with attachments, checklists, labels, and comments for better context.

3. **Swimlanes**
   - Horizontal lanes that categorize tasks by different criteria (e.g., user stories, assignees, priorities).
   - Help in organizing and visualizing tasks more effectively.

4. **WIP Limits**
   - Constraints on the number of tasks in a column.
   - Help prevent overloading team members and ensure focus on completing tasks in progress.

5. **Backlog**
   - A repository of all tasks, user stories, and requirements yet to be started.
   - Tasks are moved from the backlog to the active board based on priority and sprint planning.

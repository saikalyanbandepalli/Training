### Kubernetes Introduction

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating containerized applications. It provides a robust framework for managing containerized workloads and services, offering features such as high availability, scaling, and self-healing.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of key concepts:

#### 1. Container Orchestration

**Container Orchestration** refers to the automated process of managing the lifecycle of containers. This includes deployment, scaling, networking, and managing containerized applications.

- **Purpose:** Container orchestration is essential for managing complex containerized applications that run across a cluster of machines. It ensures that the applications are running smoothly and can recover from failures automatically.

- **Features:**
  - **Deployment:** Automates the deployment of containerized applications.
  - **Scaling:** Automatically scales the number of containers up or down based on demand.
  - **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across containers to ensure optimal performance.
  - **Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the health of containers and replaces failed ones.
  - **Configuration Management:** Manages configuration and secrets securely.

Kubernetes is one of the most popular container orchestration platforms, providing a powerful and flexible way to manage containerized applications.

#### 2. Kubernetes Architecture

**Kubernetes Architecture** consists of several key components:

- **Master Node:** Manages the Kubernetes cluster and is responsible for the overall control and management of the cluster.
  - **API Server:** Serves as the entry point for all API requests and provides a RESTful API.
  - **Controller Manager:** Ensures that the desired state of the cluster is maintained by managing controllers (e.g., Replication Controller).
  - **Scheduler:** Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and requirements.
  - **Etcd:** A distributed key-value store that holds the configuration data and state of the cluster.

- **Worker Nodes:** Run the containerized applications and are responsible for executing workloads.
  - **Kubelet:** An agent that runs on each worker node and ensures containers are running as expected.
  - **Kube-Proxy:** Manages network routing and load balancing for services.
  - **Container Runtime:** Software responsible for running the containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

- **Pods:** The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, a pod is a group of one or more containers that share storage, network, and a specification for how to run the containers.

- **Services:** Abstracts a set of pods and provides a stable endpoint for accessing them, along with load balancing and service discovery.

#### 3. Kubernetes Scheduling

**Kubernetes Scheduling** is the process of assigning pods to nodes based on resource requirements and constraints.

- **Scheduler:** The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for determining which node should run a given pod. It considers various factors such as resource availability, node affinity, and taints and tolerations.

- **Scheduling Process:**
  - **Resource Requests and Limits:** Pods specify resource requests (CPU, memory) that are considered when scheduling.
  - **Node Affinity:** Allows you to constrain which nodes your pods can be scheduled on based on node labels.
  - **Taints and Tolerations:** Taints are applied to nodes to repel certain pods, while tolerations are applied to pods to allow them to be scheduled on tainted nodes.
  - **Pod Priority and Preemption:** Pods with higher priority can preempt (evict) lower-priority pods if resources are insufficient.

- **Scheduling Strategies:** Includes round-robin, least-loaded, and custom strategies based on your specific needs.

#### 4. Kubernetes Networking

**Kubernetes Networking** manages how pods and services communicate within the cluster and with the external world.

- **Pod Networking:** Every pod gets its own IP address. Containers within the same pod can communicate with each other via `localhost`.

- **Service Networking:** Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name to access pods. Kubernetes supports several types of services:
  - **ClusterIP:** Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
  - **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
  - **LoadBalancer:** Creates an external load balancer in supported cloud providers.
  - **Headless Service:** Provides direct access to individual pods without load balancing.

- **Network Policies:** Allow you to control the communication between pods and services by defining rules that specify which traffic is allowed.

- **DNS:** Kubernetes includes an internal DNS service that automatically creates DNS records for services and pods, enabling name-based service discovery.

#### 5. kubectl Intro

**`kubectl`** is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to perform various operations such as deploying applications, inspecting cluster resources, and managing workloads.

- **Basic Commands:**
  - **Get Resources:** Lists resources in the cluster.
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get services
    kubectl get deployments
    ```
  - **Describe Resources:** Shows detailed information about a resource.
    ```sh
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    ```
  - **Apply Configurations:** Creates or updates resources from a YAML file.
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml
    ```
  - **Delete Resources:** Deletes resources from the cluster.
    ```sh
    kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
    ```
  - **Logs:** Retrieves logs from a container.
    ```sh
    kubectl logs <pod-name>
    ```

- **Configuration:** `kubectl` uses a configuration file (`kubeconfig`) to access Kubernetes clusters. You can configure multiple clusters and contexts.

- **Context Switching:** Allows you to switch between different clusters or namespaces.
  ```sh
  kubectl config use-context <context-name>
  ```

- **Helps and Documentation:** You can use `kubectl help` or `kubectl <command> --help` to get information on available commands and their usage.
